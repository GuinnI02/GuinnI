# GuinnI
My personal repository
Hello, my name is Ian Guinn and I want to be a game story writer. 
I would like to learn the basics of website development and some fundamental coding to help in my progress to working on games.
I am currently working on a prototype board game for a class of mine, type/name is TBD.
A BIG hobby of mine is Dungeons and Dragons, we play every sunday.
I hope to show you all what I continue to work on from here on out.
